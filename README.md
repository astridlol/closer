# closer

An application written to automatically close any application upon keybind. 

## But, why?

This is my first actual C++ project, I made it purely to solve a single problem I had; That being me unable to close programs without opening task manager, or opening the program itself. Basically it's just a stealth way to close programs.

### Configuration

As of right now, there is not much configuration to be done. The only thing you can do is specify a process name to be closed when the keybind (Esc + D) is pressed.
<br>The configuration is automatically generated into a file named `config.json` in the same directory as the executable.
